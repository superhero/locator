# Locator

A Node.js service locator module, designed to manage dependency injections for services, using an eager or lazy loading approach. This module simplifies service management by dynamically resolving and loading services and their dependencies, supporting wildcard service path maps and agile service resolution methods.

## Features

- **Eager Loading**: Preload services in bulk for faster access, normally done at bootstrap by an application core process.
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamically load services when they are required, and keep them accessible.
- **Wildcard Service Paths**: Resolve services using wildcard paths, to ease the service registry.
- **Locator**: Locate a service using different implementation alternatives.
- **Destroy**: Support for a graceful release of services resources.
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed errors with specific error codes for different types of errors.

## Installation

Install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install @superhero/locator
```

## Usage

### Importing the Locator

```javascript
import locator from '@superhero/locator';
```

### Lazyload a Service

```javascript
const foobar1 = await locator.lazyload('foobar', './service.js');
const foobar2 = locator.locate('foobar');
// foobar1 === foobar2
```

### Eagerload Services

```javascript
await locator.eagerload({
  serviceA: './services/serviceA.js',
  serviceB: './services/serviceB.js',
});
const serviceA = locator.locate('serviceA');
const serviceB = locator('serviceB'); // optional interface to locate
```

### Using a Wildcard Service Path

```javascript
await locator.eagerload({ 'services/*': './services/*.js' });
const serviceA = locator.locate('services/serviceA');
const serviceB = locator.locate('services/serviceB');
```

### Using Locators

Create custom locators to manage complex dependency trees.

#### Example: Exported `locate` Function

```javascript
export function locate(locator) {
  return { foobar: locator.locate('foobar') };
}
```

#### Example: Locator Class

```javascript
export class Locator {
  locate(locator) {
    return { foobar: locator.locate('foobar') };
  }
}
```

#### Example: Static Class `locate` Function

```javascript
export default class Foo {
  constructor(foobar) {
    this.foobar = foobar;
  }

  static locate(locator) {
    return new Foo(locator.locate('foobar'));
  }
}
```

### Destroy

Services can include a `destroy` method to clean up resources during shutdown or unloading. The locator will automatically call the `destroy` method for all services when the `destroy` method is invoked on the service locator.

#### Example: Using Destroy

Define a service with a `destroy` method:

```javascript
export default new class {
  destroy() {
    console.log('Service is being destroyed.');
  }
}
```

Destroy all loaded services:

```javascript
await locator.eagerload({
  serviceA: './services/serviceA.js',
  serviceB: './services/serviceB.js',
});

await locator.destroy();
```

#### Error Handling During Destroy

If a service's `destroy` method throws an error, the locator will aggregate these errors and throw a comprehensive error with details.

Example:

```javascript
try {
  await locator.destroy();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.code); // 'E_LOCATOR_DESTROY'
  console.error(error.cause); // Array of errors for each service taht failed to destroy
}
```

Error Codes:

- **E_LOCATOR_DESTROY**: Thrown when one or more destroy methods fail.
- **E_LOCATOR_DESTROY_SERVICE**: Thrown for individual service that fail to destroy.

---

### Error Handling

The module provides descriptive errors with unique codes to help debug common issues.

- **E_LOCATOR_LOCATE**: Thrown when trying to locate a non-existent service.
- **E_LOCATOR_LAZYLOAD**: Thrown when lazy loading a service fails.
- **E_LOCATOR_EAGERLOAD**: Thrown when eager loading fails.
- **E_LOCATOR_INVALID_SERVICE_MAP**: Thrown for invalid service map formats.
- **E_LOCATOR_SERVICE_UNRESOLVABLE**: Thrown when a service path cannot be resolved.
- **E_LOCATOR_INVALID_PATH**: Thrown for invalid or mismatched wildcard paths.
- **E_LOCATOR_DESTROY**: Thrown when one or more `destroy` methods fail.
- **E_LOCATOR_DESTROY_SERVICE**: Thrown for individual service `destroy` methods that fail.

Example:

```javascript
try {
  locator.locate('nonexistent/service');
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error.code, error.message);
}
```

## Running Tests

The module includes a test suite. Run the tests using:

```bash
